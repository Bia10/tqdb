Texture Viewer 1.1

Created by Max McGuire
Note this program is not officially supported by Iron Lore Entertainment.

Usage
---------------------------------------

This program allows viewing textures in the Titan Quest TEX format as well as
saving them off into various standard file formats. To use the viewer, just
put the application anywhere on your computer and run it.

The Help/Set File Association menu option will set the registry keys necessary
to associate TEX files with the application.

The application can also be run from the command line if you want to convert
TEX files into JPGs, TGAs or PSDs. When running from the command line the first
parameter is the file name of the TEX file you want to load, and the second parameter
is the name of the file to output.
